// Build game board
	-Board should probably be built using the table tag in HTML. 
	-Have the main table then 3 rows
	-Each row should have 3 cells for a total of 9 cells
	-Each cell will be individually ID'd





//JS Logic


	-Game Will Know Which user is currently up
		-Depending on which user is up, click function will either place an X or an O


	Use a Loop function that goes up to 9 to determine if the game is over or not. At the end of the loop, if the board values match a certain mathematical combination, a message will display if P1 or P2 has won, or else it will say it was a tie

//


//Build a constructor function that creates winning scenario objects

	function xWinner(cell.hasClass('x'), cell.hasClass('x'), cell.hasClass('x')) {
		this.class = class;
	}


What is a winning scenario object?

	xHasWon1 = {
		cell1: class of X
		cell2: class of X
		cell3: class of X
	}
